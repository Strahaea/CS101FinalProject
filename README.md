# CS101FinalProject
My final project for Udacity's CS 101 course

The goal of this project is to convert a given text string(representing a social network) into a useful dictionary.
This dictionary can then be probed for information such as "What is a path from one user to another?" or be used
for applications such as creating a recommendation system for users based on what their friends are doing.
